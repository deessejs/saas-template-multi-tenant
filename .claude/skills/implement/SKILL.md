# `implement` Skill

Two modes:

- **Spec-driven** (default): implement a spec-reviewed issue
- **Review-driven** (`--review`): apply requested changes from a PR review

## When to use

**Spec-driven trigger phrases:** "implement #N", "work on #N", "start #N", "/implement #N".
**Review-driven trigger phrases:** "implement #N --review", "apply review #N", "/implement #N --review".

**Prerequisite (spec-driven):** `/spec #{n}` must have been run first.
**Prerequisite (review-driven):** PR must be open with a review requesting changes.

## Workflow overview

### Spec-driven (default)

```
0. Reset      — return to staging and pull latest
1. Fetch      — read the issue + look for the spec
2. Check      — gate A: status:ready · gate B: spec exists · gate C: branch exists
3. Review     — ask for approval if not already given
4. Checkout   — fetch and checkout the branch
5. Implement  — write the code following the spec
6. Validate   — build → typecheck → test → lint → dedupe
7. Done       — git push + tell user to run /create-pr #{n}
```

### Review-driven (`--review`)

```
0. Reset      — return to staging and pull latest
1. Fetch      — PR details + review comments
2. Check      — gate A: PR open · gate B: has review with requested_changes
3. Parse      — extract all requested changes from review comments
4. Apply      — fix each blocking issue from the review
5. Validate   — build → typecheck → test → lint → dedupe
6. Push       — git push
7. Reviewer   — re-request review from original reviewer
```

# SPEC-DRIVEN MODE (default)

## §0 — Reset (always)

```bash
git checkout staging && git pull origin staging
```

## §1 — Fetch

```bash
gh api "https://api.github.com/repos/deessejs/saas-template-multi-tenant/issues/{n}"
gh api --paginate "https://api.github.com/repos/deessejs/saas-template-multi-tenant/issues/{n}/comments"
```

## §2 — Check

Three sequential gates. Refuse immediately at the first failure.

**Gate A — status:ready**

Refuse if `status:ready` label is absent:

> "Issue #{n} does not have the `status:ready` label. Run `/triage #{n}` first."

**Gate B — spec exists**

Look for `.claude/plans/{n}/plan.md` on the branch `impl/{n}-{slug}`:

```bash
gh api "https://api.github.com/repos/deessejs/saas-template-multi-tenant/contents/.claude/plans/{n}/plan.md?ref=impl/{n}-{slug}" \
  --jq '.content' 2>/dev/null | base64 -d -
```

Refuse if not found:

> "No spec found for issue #{n}. Run `/spec #{n}` first to write the implementation plan."

**Gate C — branch exists**

```bash
git fetch origin "impl/{n}-{slug}" 2>/dev/null && echo "found" || echo "missing"
```

Refuse if not on origin:

> "Branch `impl/{n}-{slug}` does not exist on origin. Run `/spec #{n}` first to create it."

## §3 — Review

Read the spec at `.claude/plans/{n}/plan.md` on the branch. Check the YAML `status` field.

- **`status: approved`** → proceed to §4 without asking
- **`status: draft`** → **blocking**: present a summary and ask for approval

When asking for approval, include:
- TL;DR from the spec
- Files count + step count
- Key risk (warn if `breaking-change` label present)
- Branch + plan path

**If approved:**
1. Update the spec YAML on the branch:
   - `status: approved`
   - `reviewer: martyy-code`
   - `reviewed: {YYYY-MM-DD}`
2. Commit the update and push
3. Proceed to §4

**If rejected:**
> "Implementation blocked. The spec remains on `impl/{n}-{slug}` at `.claude/plans/{n}/plan.md`."

## §4 — Checkout the branch

```bash
git fetch origin "impl/{n}-{slug}"
git checkout "impl/{n}-{slug}"
git merge origin/impl/{n}-{slug}  # pull latest spec if updated
```

## §5 — Implement

Read `.claude/plans/{n}/plan.md` and follow it exactly.

- Use `Edit` and `Write` to modify/create files
- Execute steps in the order listed in the Outline
- Do not deviate from the spec unless you hit a concrete contradiction — then stop and ask
- Keep the diff clean: no unrelated reformats mixed with logic changes
- If the issue has `breaking-change` label → review Risks section carefully before starting

## §6 — Validate

After every file change and again at the end, run in sequence:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm lint
pnpm dedupe:check
```

If any step fails:
1. Fix the failure
2. Re-run the full sequence
3. If the fix requires diverging from the spec → stop and ask before continuing

## §7 — Push + Done

```bash
git add {files from plan + modified files}
git commit -m "{type}: {concise description}

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

git push origin "impl/{n}-{slug}"
```

Tell the user:

> "Implementation complete and pushed to `impl/{n}-{slug}`. Now run `pnpm changeset add` to describe this change, then `/create-pr #{n}` to open the PR."

**Commit type:** match the primary area label — `ci`, `chore`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`.

**Changeset reminder:** After pushing, remind the user to run `pnpm changeset add`. This creates a `.changeset/*.md` file that documents the change type (`patch`/`minor`/`major`) and description. This file is what triggers the release workflow when the PR merges to main.

# REVIEW-DRIVEN MODE (`--review`)

## §0 — Reset (always)

```bash
git checkout staging && git pull origin staging
```

## §1 — Fetch

```bash
# PR details
gh api "https://api.github.com/repos/deessejs/saas-template-multi-tenant/pulls/{n}"

# All reviews with their comments
gh api --paginate "https://api.github.com/repos/deessejs/saas-template-multi-tenant/pulls/{n}/reviews"

# Review comments (includes file-level + line-level)
gh api --paginate "https://api.github.com/repos/deessejs/saas-template-multi-tenant/pulls/{n}/comments"

# The branch name
BRANCH=$(gh api "https://api.github.com/repos/deessejs/saas-template-multi-tenant/pulls/{n}" --jq '.head.ref')
```

## §2 — Check

**Gate A — PR must be open**

```bash
STATE=$(gh api "https://api.github.com/repos/deessejs/saas-template-multi-tenant/pulls/{n}" --jq '.state')
```

Refuse if `state != open`:

> "PR #{n} is not open ({state}). Nothing to apply."

**Gate B — must have a review with `requested_changes`**

```bash
REVIEW_STATE=$(gh api --paginate "https://api.github.com/repos/deessejs/saas-template-multi-tenant/pulls/{n}/reviews" \
  --jq '.[] | select(.state == "CHANGES_REQUESTED") | .user.login' | head -1)
```

Refuse if no review with `CHANGES_REQUESTED`:

> "PR #{n} has no review requesting changes. Run `/review-pr #{n}` first."

Capture the review author for later — this is who we re-request review from.

## §3 — Parse review comments

From the reviews + comments, extract:

- **Blocking issues** — from comments on the `requested_changes` review
- **File + line** — which file and line the comment references
- **What to change** — the body of the comment

Group comments by:
1. File changed
2. Line/section
3. Requested fix

Present the list to the user before applying:

> "Found {count} requested changes from @{reviewer}:"
>
> 1. `{file}:{line}` — {comment summary}
> 2. ...

Ask for confirmation before proceeding:

> "Apply all changes and push? (y/n)"

## §4 — Apply fixes

For each blocking comment, make the necessary edit:

- Use `Edit` or `Write` to fix the issue
- Group fixes by file when possible to keep the diff clean
- Do not make unrelated changes — stick to what the reviewer requested
- If a comment is unclear → post a reply question before proceeding

## §5 — Validate

After every file change and again at the end:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm lint
pnpm dedupe:check
```

If any step fails → fix, re-validate, continue.

## §6 — Push

```bash
git add {modified files}
git commit -m "fix: address review comments from @{reviewer}

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

git push origin "$BRANCH"
```

## §7 — Re-request review

```bash
gh api -X POST "https://api.github.com/repos/deessejs/saas-template-multi-tenant/pulls/{n}/reviews/{review_id}/events" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -f event="REQUEST_REVIEW"
```

Or via CLI (if supported):

```bash
gh pr review {n} --request-reviewer "@{reviewer}"
```

## Output

Tell the user:

> "Changes pushed and review re-requested from @{reviewer}. Run `/review-pr #{n}` again once CI passes."

# Shared error handling

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Already on a branch | §0 resets to staging automatically |
| Spec mode: not `status:ready` | Refuse — Gate A |
| Spec mode: no spec found | Refuse — Gate B |
| Spec mode: branch not on origin | Refuse — Gate C |
| Review mode: PR not open | Refuse — Gate A |
| Review mode: no requested_changes review | Refuse — Gate B |
| `breaking-change` label present | Warn and review Risks before proceeding |
| Tests fail | Fix → re-validate → ask if outside scope |
| Spec not approved | Ask for approval in §3 |

## Constraints

- **Always return to `staging` first.**
- **Never opens a PR** — run `/create-pr #{n}` after spec-driven mode.
- **Never merges** — merge to `staging` is manual, `staging → main` is also manual.
- Never push to `main`.
- Do not use `--force` to overwrite branches without permission.
